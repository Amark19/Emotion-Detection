Detecting Facial expression using python opencv &amp; deeplearning

<li>Created my own dataset using python-opencv and collected 300 images from each expressions using <b>haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml</b></li>
<li>Then,I train those by creating deep learning model using 10 epochs and got an avg accuracy of 99%</li>
<li>Then to check that using webcam I again used opencv where I load my trained model and give 4 classes and 60 as frame/IMG size.</li>
